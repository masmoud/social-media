# Social Media App

A minimal social media platform built with **React 19**, **Supabase**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TanStack Query**.

This project helped me learn how to:

- Integrate **Supabase** for database and authentication
- Use **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and mutation
- Manage global state with **Context API**
- Organize frontend with modern React practices and routing
