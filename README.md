# Social Media App

A minimal social media platform built with **React 19**, **Supabase**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TanStack Query**.

This project helped me learn to:

* Integrate **Supabase** for authentication and database features
* Use **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and mutations
* Manage global state using **Context API**
* Build clean, modern UIs with **TailwindCSS** and **React Router v7**
